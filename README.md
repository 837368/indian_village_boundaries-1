## Indian Village Boundaries
Indian Village boundaries sourced from different government websites which are freely available to all the Indians. Here we have digitized them, cleaned them, added appropriate attributes so it can be used by all the researchers, students etc

The boundaries are organized by state using state ISO code. All the village boundaries are available in geojson (WGS84, EPSG4326) format. Each boundary will have the following attributes

* NAME : Name of the Village/Town/City as per census
* CENSUS_CODE_2001: Code as per 2001 census
* CENSUS_CODE_2011: Code as per 2011 census
* STATE: State or UT name as per census
* DISTRICT : District name as per census
* SUB_DISTRICT: Sub District name as per census

The below table gives you the status of the data as we clean and upload. Data is not perfect there as many errors both in data and boundaries. You can contribute by sending the pull requests. Please use the census names when correcting the attributes and geojson for shapes.
